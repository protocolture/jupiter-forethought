Purpose: To emulate a terminal using physical hardware (IE instead of using a web browser or similar to proxy an emulator in a sane fashion as others have done)

Recommendation: I run the script at login (after automatically logging in), suppressing startup messages. I actually built a bootstrap script, that lets me push commands in between boot and loading the script which is probably the closest thing here to "Best Practices". 

If you use it in this way as a login script you get the side benefit of this working via SSH.

For any new user accounts you create, add a directory with that name to the top level (per the others) recommend to seed them with at least one of each gif and txt files. Then copy the relevant code from the case statement and set up an unique name and password. I would have done this rationally but its not really that interesting. If you need scalable user accounts in here then maybe reconsider this as a platform, or send me lots of money to develop it.
