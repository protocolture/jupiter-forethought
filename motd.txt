Instead of cursing the darkness, light a flamethrower.
The quieter you become, the more your sensors detect.
The corporations can share, but for you it costs money. 
Live as if you were to decompile tomorrow.
In space, only the software is free. 
Space is dark because She doesn't want us to see.
The End is here. Bring pretzels.
